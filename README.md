# ECE5725-Pi-Billiard-Assistant

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of **Pi Billiard Assitant**. It is the final project for Cornell University ECE5725 Design with Embedded Operating Systems (SP23) by Zim Gong and Yixin Zang. Like its name, the project builds a billiard assistant that shows the possible hit trajectory based on the position of the cue on the billiard table. To make the project work, a Raspberry Pi board, a camera, a laptop, and internet connection is needed. The project is coded in Python, using OpenCV for computer vision, zmq for frame transmission between devices and PyGame for user interface. The project has just finished its demo run, and detailed documentation is expected to be updated.
